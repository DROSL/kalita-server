# kalita-js

**Kalita** a is text-to-speech software with a special focus on data minimization and user privacy. We do not collect any personal data, do not set tracking cookies and do not outsource our service to third-party cloud solutions. The speech synthesis takes place on-premises on your own server and still offers many of the conveniences of a conventional readspeaker.

- [**kalita-server**](https://github.com/azmke/kalita-server) is a server written in Python that provides the speech synthesis.
- [**kalita-js**](https://github.com/azmke/kalita-js) is a JavaScript client for integration into a website that provides a graphical user interface.

## Install TTS
Kalita is tested on Windows 10 with **python 3.8.9**.

```bash
pip install TTS
```

The underlying coquiTTS uses ```espeak-ng``` to convert graphemes to phonemes. You might need to install separately [HERE](http://espeak.sourceforge.net/download.html). Or on Linux distributions via console:

```bash
sudo apt-get install espeak-ng
```

## Using the server

After the installation, Kalita provides a CLI interface for synthesizing speech as a server.

```bash
python server.py
```

After the server started you can send requests to the server.

```bash
GET http://localhost:3000/api/tts?text=Here%20comes%20your%20text&language=english
```
