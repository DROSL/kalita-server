# kalita-server

**Kalita** a is text-to-speech software with a special focus on data minimization and user privacy. We do not collect any personal data, do not set tracking cookies and do not outsource our service to third-party cloud solutions. The speech synthesis takes place on-premises on your own server and still offers many of the conveniences of a conventional readspeaker.

- [**kalita-server**](https://github.com/azmke/kalita-server) is a server written in Python that provides the speech synthesis.
- [**kalita-js**](https://github.com/azmke/kalita-js) is a JavaScript client for integration into a website that provides a graphical user interface.

| ðŸ’¾ **Installation**               | [TTS/README.md](https://github.com/azmke/kalita-server#install-tts)|

## Install TTS
Kalita is tested on Windows 10 with **python 3.8.9**.

Prequesites:

* Python 3.6 < Version < 3.9
* OpenJDK Version >= 16.0.0
* Gradle Version >= 7.0

The underlying coquiTTS uses ```espeak-ng``` to convert graphemes to phonemes. You might need to install separately [HERE](http://espeak.sourceforge.net/download.html). Or on Linux distributions via console:

```bash
> sudo apt-get install espeak-ng
```

To convert text to speech we need to install coquiTTS as initial setup:

```bash
> pip install TTS
```

## Build Java Server
Continue with "Using the server" if you already have the .jar file.

```bash
> gradle wrapper
> gradlew shadowJar
```

The .jar file gets saved to ./build/libs/

## Using the server
Configure the address and port of the **Java server** in the **config.properties** file.

Configure the address and port of the **Python server** in the **server.py** in line 105.

Start both servers:
```bash
> java -jar build/libs/kalita-server-java-1.0.jar
```

```bash
> python server.py
```

After the server started you can send requests to the server.

```bash
> GET http://localhost:3000/api/tts?text=Here%20comes%20your%20text
```
